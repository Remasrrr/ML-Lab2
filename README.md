# ARTI 308 - Machine Learning Lab 2

## Problem Statement
This project aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on medical measurements. 
This is a classification problem because the target variable is categorical (malignant or benign). 
The model learns patterns from the dataset and predicts the tumor type.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer dataset available in the sklearn library. 
It contains 569 samples and 31 features, including medical measurements such as mean radius, texture, and area. 
There are no missing values in the dataset.
